# Savarrior: Animal Rescue & Vegan Lifestyle App

## Overview

**Savarrior** is a mission-driven mobile application empowering users to take action in animal rescue, report cruelty, and embrace a vegan lifestyle. Developed with React Native, Savarrior bridges the gap between immediate help and education, providing tools to both report emergencies and access resources on animal welfare and plant-based living.

This project is open source for educational and non-commercial use only, inviting community contributions while retaining authorship by decodeaditya.
